To begin the game, the player will have to choose which item they would like to choose: Rock or Paper or Scissors. 
The player should choose one of the three options. After the player chooses their choice, the computer will display its choice, 
the playerâ€™s choice, and the match winner. If the player chose to play more than one match, then the player will be prompted to
choose rock, paper, or scissors again, and the process will repeat until the player chooses the QUIT button to exit the game. 
There are unlimited rounds to play on the computer until the player decides to quit by selecting the QUIT button.
